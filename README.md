# alpine-mtr
run interactive mtr to google.de


## Usage
```
# Linux / Mac
bash run.sh

# Windows (switch to bash first)
winpty bash run.sh
```

## mtr shortcuts
```
h     - Help
p     - Pause
Space - Resume
d     - switching display mode
r     - reset
```

## why shoud I run run.sh?
The docker image gets build based on alpine:latest and the container and the image is getting deleted after running interactive mtr
